<a id="Story" class="anchor" href="#Story" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Story</h3>
<p>Once upon a time, in the ancient Latin city of Gabii lived a woman and a child. It is within the city, on a low rock-cut terrace, west of the side street leading to the once Area Urbana where our story takes place. However, to firmly grasp an understanding of the lives and subsequent deaths of these two individuals, we must first recognize the historical context in which the story occurs.</p> 	

<p>Emerging in the Early Iron Age, Gabii demonstrated extensive urbanization before its descent in the first century B.C.E. Over time the Imperial Period gave way to a rapid expansion of quarry works. Consequently, structures of the area became untenable, and it lied abandoned until the late first century C.E. when a small necropolis began to grow in the area of the former structures – the home to our two protagonists somewhere between the third and fifth centuries C.E.. </p>

<p>The complex Roman social structure at the time demonstrated a distinction amongst the place of children as compared to their adult counterparts. Of note were the structured rites and activities of a child’s life, which often were defined by age and gender: at each stage in life and for each gender, there were culturally appropriate duties and tasks expected (CITE). This fact seems to have helped shape the place of children within the Roman social fabric, from helping to determine how they were raised and educated, to formulating what attitudes adults had towards children and childhood, to constructing the rituals for commemorating them when they died. Exemplification of such attitudes is particularly manifested throughout the archaeological record with respect to burial practices: children were often buried in ways that are distinct from those for adults, either in form or location, or both (CITE).</p>

<p>Deaths and funerals were frequent given the high mortality of ancient times: disease, recurrent epidemics, and hazardous everyday conditions characteristic of an urbanizing central Italy. For example, preliminary tests of diseased within the area show evidence of physical stresses and injuries common with repetitive motions as well as more traumatic wounds that would be common among manual laborers, potentially in an agricultural or quarry working environment (CITE GE). As such, it would not be unreasonable to infer that based on age (approximated by the size of the skeleton) and gender, the woman in question potentially worked in agricultural, which could have contributed to her death. Children particularly, as in most pre-industrial societies, were subject to a relatively high mortality rate as well. Therefore, while a definitive cause of death might remain unknown, it can conclusively be said that a death as seen by the woman and child in the grave of question was not an uncommon occurrence.</p>

<p>Italian towns had laws to regulate the disposal of the dead. Cemeteries were normally situated outside the defined limits of the town, along a major road (CITE). The burials that belonged to the first through third centuries C.E. were predominately cremations. However, by the fourth century, inhumation had replaced cremation as the principal rite practiced generally throughout the Western Roman Empire (CITE). Fourth century adult inhumations were characterized by modest means: the dead was placed into a grave and then covered with either roof tiles or broken amphora fragments. The absence of an above ground marker and/or grave goods was not uncommon. Thus the typical, relative lacking of grave goods may not provide an indication of the wealth or status of the deceased as previously hypothesized. Child burials demonstrated similar practices – all were inhumed, whether in sandstone cists, amphoras or lined graves capped with tiles. (CITE). Therefore, it is probable that the woman and child, both found within cappuccina style burials, belonged to the time between third and fifth century C.E..</p>

<p>The burial strategy of the area appears to be variable with some tombs demonstrating more elaborate preparation than others, and there seems to be no discernible pattern to the organization of the tombs in either period. Thus while there is a possibility the two individuals share a mother-child relationship, there is no direct evidence supporting this beyond the proximity of the graves.</p>

<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">using GitHub Flavored Markdown</a>, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new <code>gh-pages</code> branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
