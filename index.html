<a id="Story" class="anchor" href="#Story" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Story</h3>
<p>Once upon a time, in the ancient Latin city of Gabii lived a woman and a child. It is within the city, on a low rock-cut terrace, west of the side street leading to the once Area Urbana where our story takes place. However, to firmly grasp an understanding of the lives and subsequent deaths of these two individuals, we must first recognize the historical context in which the story occurs.</p> 	
 
<p>Emerging in the Early Iron Age, Gabii demonstrated extensive urbanization before its descent in the first century B.C.E. Over time the Imperial Period gave way to a rapid expansion of quarry works. Consequently, structures of the area became untenable, and it lied abandoned until the late first century C.E. when a small necropolis began to grow in the area of the former structures – the home to our two protagonists somewhere between the third and fifth centuries C.E. (Mogetta and Becker 2014).</p>

<p>The complex Roman social structure at the time demonstrated a distinction amongst the place of children as compared to their adult counterparts. Of note were the structured activities of a child’s life, which often were defined by age and gender: at each stage in life and for each gender, there were culturally appropriate duties and tasks expected (Norman 2002). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume culture constructs contributed significantly not only to children’s’ assigned place within the social structure but also to decisions regarding how children should be raised, educated and even buried. Exemplification of such attitudes is particularly manifested throughout the archaeological record with respect to burial practices: children were often buried in ways distinct from those of adults, either in form or location, or both (Norman 2002).</p>

<p>Deaths and funerals were frequent given the high mortality of ancient times: disease, recurrent epidemics, and hazardous everyday conditions characteristic of an urbanizing central Italy (Rawson 2003). For example, preliminary tests of diseased within the area show evidence of physical stresses and injuries common with repetitive motions as well as more traumatic wounds that would be common among manual laborers, potentially in an agricultural or quarry working environment (Mogetta and Becker 2014). As such, it would not be unreasonable to infer that based on age (approximated by the size of the skeleton) and gender, the woman in question potentially worked in agricultural, which could have contributed to her death. Children particularly, as in most pre-industrial societies, were subject to a relatively high mortality rate as well (Becker and Nowlin 2011). Therefore, while a definitive cause of death might remain unknown, it can conclusively be said that a death as seen by the woman and child in the grave of question was not an uncommon occurrence.</p>

<p>Cemeteries were normally situated outside the defined limits of the town, along a major road (Rawson 2003). While regulations regarding the disposal of the dead were dictated by cities, burial practices were subject to time.  For instance, burials belonging to the first through third centuries C.E. were predominately cremations; however, by the fourth century, inhumation had replaced cremation as the primary practiced custom throughout the Western Roman Empire. Specific to the fourth century, adult inhumations were characterized by modest means: the dead was placed into a grave and then covered with either roof tiles or broken amphora fragments. The absence of an above ground marker and/or grave goods was also not uncommon (Norman 2002). Thus the typical, relative lacking of grave goods may not provide an indication of the wealth or status of the deceased as previously hypothesized. Child burials demonstrated similar practices – all were inhumed, whether in sandstone cists, amphoras or lined graves capped with tiles. (Norman 2002). Therefore, in addition to the supporting analysis of the stratigraphic sequence, it is probable that the woman and child, both found within cappuccina style burials, belonged to the time between third and fifth century C.E.</p>

<p>The burial strategy of the area appears to be variable with some tombs demonstrating more elaborate preparation than others, and there seems to be no discernible pattern to the organization of the tombs in either period (Mogetta and Becker 2014). Thus while there is a possibility the two individuals share a mother-child relationship, there is no direct evidence supporting this beyond the proximity of the graves.</p>

<a id="Details" class="anchor" href="#Details" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Details</h3>

<p><em>The following provides a more detailed account of the individuals’ skeletons and corresponding graves, with direct reference to specific stratigraphic units. Feature descriptions were generated using the Ark Database.</em></p>

<p>Both graves were found within Area B, the central, northern part of sector. The grave of the child (SU 1336) is shallow and cut sharply into the bedrock lying directly perpendicular to the irregularly shaped, rock cut grave of Marcia (SU 1197). Based on the anthropological evidence, both of the deceased were placed in the common supine position. Details regarding the skeleton of Marcia (SU 1195) are restricted to being that of a female adult skeleton. The child skeleton (SU 1334) was found be disarticulated within the bedrock. In the case of both burials, there was an absence of grave goods.</p>

<p>The stratigraphic sequence of Area B shows evidence of at least two superimposed levels of burials: the earlier phase belonging to the first and second centuries C.E., while the latter phase belonged to the third to fifth centuries C.E. (Mogetta and Becker 2014). In addition to the support provided by the historical context, examination of the corresponding fills of each grave suggests both burials belonged to the latter phase.</p>

<a id="Analysis" class="anchor" href="#Analysis" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Analysis</h3>

<p><em>This section provides a brief background of Roman burial practices featuring various perspectives: cultural, historical, anthropological, biological, etc. The following information was provided during a Digital Antiquity lecture taught by Dr. Rachel Optiz at the University of Arkansas Fayetteville.</em></p>

<p>To fully understand the archaeological significance, these burials must be examined within the scope of ancient Roman burial practices. Common to the time period were three variations of burial practices: cremation, inhumation, and embalmment. Subsequent funerary rites were then determined by factors such as socioeconomic class distinctions and/or military service. Post funeral practices were common, especially those pertaining to cleansing and feasting. For example, upon returning from the funeral, it was common for relatives to partake in a period of cleansing ceremonies (feria denicales) in addition to undergoing purification by fire and water (sufficio). A funerary feast (silicernium) was also held and many occasion meals throughout the year were eaten at the tomb. Burial types ranged from inhumations to primary and secondary burials. Inhumations encompassed burials in which bodies were interred unburned. Bodies located in the place where originally interred and those that were interred then reinterred upon decomposition were considered primary and secondary burials, respectively.</p>

<p>In addition to ritualistic examination, analysis is also done by physical inspection. Amongst the first assessed is the body position and orientation: tightly flexed-knees drawn towards body versus limbs extended-stretched out, prone-lying flat on stomach versus supine-lying flat on back, etc. Subsequent analyses occur at a multitude of levels. Initial sorting produces general categorization of bone elements and fragments. Metric analysis yields measurement of various bones, which can offer a source of inference regarding specific details such as stature and cranial index. The highest level comprises techniques that utilize technology to convey details including but not limited to sustained trauma, pathology, diet, DNA, and dental history. Each level contributes to estimations of age, sex, stature, and race, which cumulatively provide the connection between the physical and historical that is required to make the most accurate interpretations. For instance, physical examination might yield results pertaining to bone condition and pathologies that in turn could be used to infer overall health of the individual and, in a broader context, potential facets regarding social status, living conditions, and so on.</p>
